I'm an engineer student in France and I 💟 Artificial Intelligence. 

That's why I do a lot of little projects mostly where I try to discover new things in Machine Learning 

## 🌱 I'm currently learning

- Speech Recognition and TTS
- NLP: Conversational AI
- Computer Vision: GANs, CNN
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting...
- Optimization Algorithms: Branch&Bound, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, MCTS

## 💻 Coding

I do most of my projects in Python with Machine Learning frameworks:
- Pytorch
- Tensorflow
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
